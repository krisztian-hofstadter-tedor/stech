Download link for video material will be provided after you signed a confidentiality form. If you would like to use an alternative material, it needs to be discussed with the module tutor by week 5. 

A2, A3, A4 can be replaced by a project focusing on audio-visual programming in SuperCollider, Processing, Max, Jitter, Isodora, ... I will introduce these software and ideas to you later. 

You can also write music for one of these assignments to be performed live by an ensamble. We'll discuss options for this with Will Crosby in week 01.

#### Website   
Create a simple website with the following features:

* Embedded SoundCloud or Bandcamp music player with your assignment's audio. You can embed music made not specifically for this module on your website as well (try to showcase different genres, emotions, ...); Remember, you **mustn't** share the visual material (and poems) without the permission of the author, copyright holder. In other words only your music can go public, not the original assignment material.

#### Dropbox

Save your work on a regular basis. Have you got Dropbox? 

### Assignment Criteria
Your work will be marked according to the criteria set out in the document [Artefact Creation](http://web.anglia.ac.uk/anet/faculties/alss/public/Artefact%20Creation.pdf). It will be marked by your tutor and moderated by another staff in the music department. Selected submissions will also be examined by external examiners from other universities.


### Most important advice

The assignments should be considered as your own projects, not something you have to do for me or the university. Follow the rules outlined provided in this module guide, assessment criteria, etc., however, please keep in mind that the outcomes of your assignments can (and should) become part of your professional portfolios, which you later can use for networking, job hunting.
