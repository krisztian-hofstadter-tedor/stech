## how to compose an imaginary soundscape?

Let's start with an exercise.

1. Read all haikus below.
2. Listen to the compositions.
3. Try to match a haiku to a composition.


> My Life;-   
> How much more of it remains?   
> The night is brief.    

---



> Nude Beach   
> Nothing New   
> Under The Sun   



---


> The Depths, Swelling Green   
> Leviathan Walks, Waves Break   
> Cold Sleet, it is here.

---

> The wind of war   
> Blowing across my face   
> The thunder roaring loudly   



---

> An SSBN   
> Moves silently through the deep -   
> Five knots to nowhere.   

---

> Tremble, oh my gravemound,   
> in time my cries will be   
> only this autumn wind

Key: kettő, kilenc, tíz, tizenhárom, tizennyolc, nyolc (in order).

What was similar in these compositions?   
Are the haikus compositions?   
What does it mean to compose?   
What was different?   
Would you have interpreted poems in similar ways into music?  
Now, that you have heard an example of someone's interpretation, is your imagination guided in a certain way?

* So what is an imaginary soundscape? How can we compose one? Let's the [terminology](/terminology) page.  
* Read the poems, choose one.
* Close your eyes and imagine the happenings, pictures, movements. There might be animals, humans, machines, nature, synthetic sounds, abstract sounds, conversations, real environments... Hear and listen to their sounds. What is the difference between hearing and listening?
* Capture the emotional content, rhythm, pace, form.
* Use a pen and paper, draw a picture or a map. Imagine moving inside your new world, listen.
* Think about the relationship of your objects, compare them to each other, find differences and similarities in the way they look, feel, sound.
* Make sound recordings of voice, traditional instruments, synthesise sounds, use sound libraries as well as DSP (Digital Signal Processing) e.g. filtering, panning, reverb, delay... to create a palette of objects, the building blocks of your new world.
* Analyse the waveform of a poem's sound recording. There might be a picture in there:

* Organise these objects into a composition so that it has a flow, where the listener can immerse in a journey inside your a1, your _imaginary soundscape_. In other words, create a narrative, a story.
* Use detailed musical expressions, nuances, to guide the listener. Incorporate appropriate music theory.
* Think about space, acoustics, the movement of the listener vs. movement of listener's focus. What is the difference?

Any other ideas?
