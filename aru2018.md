Module leader: [Krisztián Hofstädter](https://khofstadter.info)  
Module title: sensor technology   
Module code: MOD000607   
Wednesday 10:00 – 13:00    
Helmore 038A, Cambridge
<br>
## introduction
Music for the Moving Image allows you to create original music and sound design that _plays_ with poetry, short films and video games using acoustic and computer-based methods of composition. Each assignment provides a variety of options, which can be extended with your own collaborations e.g. with students or professionals from related fields in the wider University or beyond. The practical assignments shall encourage you to develop a range of compositional techniques, using appropriate computer software and hardware in order to become competitive in your career as an artist. Assessment is via the production of a portfolio of the assignments, each accompanied by a succinct commentary.
<br>

<br>


### what to submit?

There are two main parts to your submission:

1) Your portfolio needs to be submitted as a webpage on GitHub, where according to the NDA form, your embedded video material **must** be protected with a password.

2) On Canvas you need to submit a pdf file with your GitHub url and the password protecting your videos.

A template for this GitHub website will be provided and explained further in class.

<br>

### extra points

### presentation
A 10 min oral presentation where you demonstrate how music and sound design was used in a film, game or some project with audio content. You could consider investigating lists like [this](http://www.nme.com/photos/61-of-the-greatest-film-soundtracks-ever/207108#/photo/15) or even [this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=best+film+music&oq=best+film+music+&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65.3621j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Also, have a look at the reading list, perhaps you find something there.

### assignment criteria
Your work will be marked according to the criteria set out in [this](https://github.com/krisztian-hofstadter-tedor/m4mi/blob/gh-pages/assets/txt/marking_criteria.pdf) document. It will be marked by me and moderated by another staff in the music department. Selected submissions will also be examined by external examiners from other universities.

<br><br>

### most important advice
The assignments should be considered as your own projects, not something you have to do for me or the university. Follow the rules outlined in this module guide, assessment criteria, etc., however, please keep in mind that the outcomes of your assignments can (and should) become part of your professional portfolios, which you later can use for networking, job hunting, etc.

**Do it for yourself, not for me!**
